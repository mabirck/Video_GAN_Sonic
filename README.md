# GAN_PRE_META_RL

This was an early attempt to replicate "Deep multi-scale video prediction beyond mean square error" to be used in Gym-Retro environments more specific in Sonic and it would be used a posteriori for transfer learning purposes.
After some reading I end up quiting the idea and keep implementing it in with another GAN approach, check it out in here -> LINK
